# TEMPLATE for the rolling nightly cask. The nightly workflow (release-nightly.yml)
# renders @VERSION@ (full pre-release semver, so `brew upgrade` sees each new build),
# @SHA256@ (the published DMG's checksum) and @DMG@ (the version-stamped DMG filename),
# then pushes the result to the tap as Casks/klardrop-nightly.rb.
#
# Install:  brew install --cask carlonzo/klardrop/klardrop-nightly
#
# Separate token from the stable `klardrop` cask so a tester can track nightly without
# clobbering a stable install. ponytail: assumes the nightly DMG is notarized (Apple
# secrets present) — an unsigned nightly installs but Gatekeeper blocks first launch.
